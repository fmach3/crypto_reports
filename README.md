# crypto_reports
This script accesses Gemini.com Rest API and calculates moving averages and other metrics to aggregate the market status in a custom scaled rolling report structure. This allows the reliable and repeatible measurement of the market for timing purposes.

This script was developed to allow a research project into the patterns of crypto markets for the further design of trading software.

It will also send you telegram updates for any metrics you code into it.
